If that's the case, you should know that the simplest form of backend development in Node.js happens in the form of a HTTP server. This is a server that listens for HTTP requests and responds to them. The most common way to do this is with the Express framework. As such, we recommend to familiarize yourself with the basic concepts of an HTTP server and Express before continuing. Here are some resources:\nExpress documentation\nFull Stack course - Express\n\nNote that the course above uses MongoDB to store data, but we are using PostgreSQL. I recommend skipping the MongoDB part and just focusing on the Express part. You probably don't need to know a lot about databases to get started with this project, but we will handle this in a bit more detail in the next section.","have-used-nodejs-before#Have used Node.js before":"If you have used Node.js before for backend development, you have probably used either Express, or a similar framework. This section will mainly focus on becoming familiar with the structure of our backend and the main libraries we are using.

Here are some resources to get you started:\nReact Documentation\nFull Stack course\n\nWhile the React docs should be enough to familiarize yourself with React, the Full Stack course can be a great, but exhaustive resource to learn everything about React and web development in general. Not all parts of the course are relevant, and some parts cover some more basic concepts that you might already know (like HTTP requests), you can always skip those parts. Do note that the first parts are all in JavaScript, there is a part specifically about TypeScript (part 9) but in general, TypeScript does not differ much from JavaScript when it comes to React.

For this, we use a so called \"IDE\" or \"Integrated Development Environment\". For web development, there are 2 popular options: Visual Studio Code and WebStorm. While both work fine, we recommend using VSCode since it's free and has better support for extensions in the case of our project. The final choice, however, is up to you.","visual-studio-code#Visual Studio Code":"Visual Studio Code, also known as just VSCode, is a free, open-source IDE developed by Microsoft. It's available for Windows, macOS and Linux and is the most popular IDE for web development. To start, download the installer from the official website and install it.","extensions#Extensions":"VSCode has a built-in extension marketplace, where you can find and install extensions for the IDE. We recommend installing the following extensions:\nWSL (when using WSL)\nPrettier - Code formatter\nPrettier ESLint\nESLint\nDocker\nPrisma\nPostgreSQL\nGraphQL: Language Feature Support\nGraphQL: Syntax Highlighting\nLive Share\n\nThese extensions should allow for an easier time when working on our project, we'll quickly go over what they do:\nWSL: This extension allows you to use VSCode as your IDE for WSL, it is very much recommended to use this extension when using VSCode and WSL in any capacity.\nPrettier: This extension allows you to automatically format your code to a consistent style. This is very useful for our project, since we have a strict code style that we follow.\nESLint: This extension allows you to automatically lint your code, which means it will automatically check for errors and inconsistencies in your code. This is also very useful for our project, since we have a strict code style that we follow.\nDocker: This extension allows you to easily manage Docker containers and images from within VSCode. Can be useful but not a requirement since Docker Desktop does the same thing.\nPrisma: This extension allows you to easily manage Prisma schemas and migrations from within VSCode. Very much recommended if you need to adjust the database schema.\nPostgreSQL: This extension allows you to easily manage PostgreSQL databases from within VSCode. Useful if you want to manually query the database.\nGraphQL: This extension allows you to write and format GraphQL queries and mutations. Very much recommended if you are writing any GraphQL code in the frontend.\nLive Share: This extension allows you to share your VSCode instance with other people, allowing you to work together on the same code. Very useful if you want to work together with other people on the project or if you need any (remote) help.","recommended-settings#Recommended settings":"To make VSCode work best with our project, we recommend changing the following settings:\nEditor: Format on Save: This setting will automatically format your code when you save it. This is very useful for our project, since we have a strict code style that we follow.\nProject-specific settings: Both the frontend and backend repositories contain a .vscode folder with additional settings that are specific to that project. These settings are automatically applied when opening the project in VSCode, so you don't have to do anything.","tips#Tips":"Use WSL: We recommend using WSL for development, since it allows you to use the same development environment on all platforms. If you are using WSL, make sure to install the WSL extension for VSCode. When opening a folder in VSCode, you can open it from WSL by pressing \"F1\" and typing \"Open Folder in WSL\", this is way faster than opening the folder in Windows.\nDon't be afraid to use the Git tab: Newcomers might have some difficulty in using command-line Git, so we recommend using the built-in Git support in VSCode. To use Git in VSCode, simply open the Git tab in the left sidebar, from here you can commit, push, pull, etc. This works even better if you combine it with VSCode workspaces (see below).\nCreate a workspace for the project: VSCode allows you to create a workspace for a project, which allows you to easily open the project in VSCode. This is very useful if you are working on multiple projects at the same time, since you can easily switch between them. To create a workspace, simply open the project folder in VSCode and click on \"Add Folder to Workspace\" in the bottom left corner.\nFind useful extensions: VSCode has a built-in extension marketplace, where you can find and install extensions for the IDE. We recommend installing the extensions mentioned above, but you can also find other useful extensions there. For example, you can find extensions for syntax highlighting for other languages, such as Python, C++, etc.\nPersonalize VSCode: VSCode is highly customizable, you can change the color theme, the font, the keybindings, etc. You can also install extensions that allow you to customize the UI, such as Material Icon Theme and Material Theme.","webstorm#WebStorm":"😬"}},"/setup":{"title":"Index","data":{"":"This entire wiki assumes the use of an unix-based system.

You can find a lot of resources for Python on the internet, but here are some of our favorites:\nPython Beginner's Guide\nPython for Everybody (freeCodeCamp)\n\nWhile the syntax for Python is quite different from JavaScript, the concepts are very similar. So if you learn Python first, you will have an easier time learning JavaScript later on.","have-done-some-programming-before#Have done some programming before":"Whether you have done some programming in JavaScript, Java or Python, the fundamentals are mostly the same. It is, however, important that you become familiar with the JavaScript syntax and also start grasping the fundamentals of TypeScript and Node.js. In essence, TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, so you can use JavaScript in TypeScript, but you can also use some of the more advanced features of TypeScript. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment, which means that you can run JavaScript code outside of the browser. Here are some resources to help you learn both:\nJavaScript Tutorial\nIntroduction to Node.js\nTypeScript Handbook\n\nIf you have not used JavaScript before, we also recommend looking at the section above for absolute beginners to get a good foundation.Please note that Node.js setup is covered in the setup section of this guide.","have-used-typescript-before#Have used TypeScript before":"If you have used TypeScript before, chances are that you are already familiar with Node.js. If you are not, please look at the section above to familiarize yourself with Node.js. If you understand the basics of TypeScript, you should be good to get started with the next sections of this guide.","where-to-go-from-here#Where to go from here":"Now that you have a good foundation, you can start looking at the backend section or frontend section. We highly recommend that you start with the backend section, since it is the most important part of the application. If you are not interested in the backend, you can also start with the frontend section, but you will probably have to learn the backend later on anyway."}}}
