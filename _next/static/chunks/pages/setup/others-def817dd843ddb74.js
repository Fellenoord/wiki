If you have ever interacted with a REST API before, you might have used something like Postman or Insomnia. Altair is like those 2 programs but for GraphQL. While Postman and Insomnia do support GraphQL, Altair has some additional features that just makes it easier to work with GraphQL. With Altair, you'll be able to write and execute GraphQL queries to the backend, you can also see the schema of the backend and the documentation of the queries and mutations. It is a must have if you want to test your queries seperately from the frontend. While you can download it as a Windows application, we recommend downloading the browser extension instead, we have had some issues with authentication when using the Windows application."]}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"prisma-studio",children:"Prisma Studio"}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(t.p,{children:["Not as much as a desktop tool as a simple script, Prisma Studio allows you to introspect your schema and explore your database from the browser.
