## The `main` branch

The main branch consists of all the code that has been squashed and merged through a pull request. The idea is that all code on `main` works. It is not possible to directly push code to this branch.

## Branch naming

We follow this branch naming structure:

```
<issue_id>-<description>
# or
feat/<description>
# or
fix/<description>
```

In Git, we can use the shorthand to checkout and create a branch:

```bash
git checkout -b <branch>
```

## Committing code to the repository

All commits *must* follow the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification). The commit message should be structured as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Here, the types can be as follows: `fix`, `feat`, `build`, `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf` or `test`. Furthermore, make sure that the commit message length does not exceed 50 characters. An example commit would look something like this:

```
feat(activity): allow user to register
â€‹
This adds the logic for activity registration and stores the ActivityRegistration to the database.
```
