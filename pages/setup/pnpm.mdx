By default, Node.js comes with a package manager called Node Package Manager (NPM). However, we use the pnpm package manager. To ensure consistent pnpm versions across contributors, we recommend using Corepack (bundled with Node.js v16.13+).

**Recommended (with Corepack):**
```bash
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
```

Check your installation using `pnpm --version`.
