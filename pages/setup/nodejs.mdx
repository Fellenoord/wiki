When using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) it recommended to use the [Node Version Manager (NVM)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to quickly install and use different versions of node via the command line. Run and download the script using cURL: 

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
```

Then, after reopening the terminal, use `nvm --version` to check if it has installed properly. Finally, we can install the latest version of Node using `nvm install --lts`.
