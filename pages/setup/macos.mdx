## Homebrew

When using MacOS it is recommended to use the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager. It installs stuff using the command line. To install homebrew simply run the following:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
