There are a few more programs that can be of use when working on the project. We'll briefly discuss them here and explain how they can be used.

## GitHub Desktop
Can be downloaded from [here](https://desktop.github.com/). GitHub Desktop can be seen as an alternative to the Git CLI (command line interface). It is a graphical user interface that allows you to interact with GitHub without having to use the command line. It is a very useful tool for beginners, but it is not necessary to use it. You can use the Git CLI or the Git tab in VSCode instead.

## Altair GraphQL Client
Can be downloaded from [here](https://altairgraphql.dev/). If you have ever interacted with a REST API before, you might have used something like Postman or Insomnia. Altair is like those 2 programs but for GraphQL. While Postman and Insomnia do support GraphQL, Altair has some additional features that just makes it easier to work with GraphQL. With Altair, you'll be able to write and execute GraphQL queries to the backend, you can also see the schema of the backend and the documentation of the queries and mutations. It is a must have if you want to test your queries seperately from the frontend. While you can download it as a Windows application, we recommend downloading the browser extension instead, we have had some issues with authentication when using the Windows application.

## Prisma Studio
Not as much as a desktop tool as a simple script, Prisma Studio allows you to introspect your schema and explore your database from the browser. It can be useful to quickly see database data, but it is not very advanced. You can read about it [here](https://www.prisma.io/studio), to run it, simply open the backend folder in VSCode and run `npx prisma studio` in the terminal.

## pgAdmin
Can be downloaded from [here](https://www.pgadmin.org/). pgAdmin is a graphical user interface for PostgreSQL. It allows you to create and manage databases, tables, views, etc. It can be useful if you want to learn more about PostgreSQL, but it is probably not needed for this project. We recommend using the CLI, Prisma Studio or the VSCode extension instead.
