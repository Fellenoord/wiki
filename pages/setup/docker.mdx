The use of Docker is recommended, since this removes the need to set up databases and other dependencies locally.

To get started with Docker, download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

> It is also possible to set up Docker without Docker Desktop, but we will not cover that here.

If you're using WSL, make sure to check the `Use the WSL 2 based engine` option in Docker Desktop's settings.
