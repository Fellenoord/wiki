A guide to get Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) up and running for web development. It will cover setting up the WSL environment, and all the tools needed.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you are on a recent build of Windows (20262+, and preferably Windows 11). The guide has been tested for Microsoft Windows Version 22H2 (OS Build 22621.963). To check your version and build number, select `WIN + R`, type `winver`, and select `OK`. Furthermore, if you prefer a different Linux distribution other than Ubuntu, please refer to the sources below.

With Windows 11, Windows Terminal is installed by default. If you do not have Windows Terminal, please follow [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install) guide to do so.

## Get started

Open PowerShell, and enter:

```PowerShell
wsl --install
```

This enables the WSL and Virtual Machine Platform components, downloads and installs the latest Linux kernel, sets WSL 2 as the default, and downloads and installs the Ubuntu Linux distribution.

You will need to restart your machine to complete the installation process.

## Set up Linux

After the restart a terminal window will open to setup your Linux distribution. Now you will be asked to create username and password.

- These credentials have no bearing on your Windows username and password.
- Note that whilst entering the password, nothing will appear on screen (blind typing).
- This will be the default user, and considered the Linux administrator, with the ability to run `sudo` (Super User Do) commands.

To change or reset your password find more information [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment#set-up-your-linux-username-and-password).

It is recommended to keep your packages up-to-date. So after we reach the login screen we update and upgrade:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

## Learning more

Installing and using WSL can be daunting at first, especially if you have never used a unix-like operating system before. To help you get started, here are some resources:
- [Linux Journey](https://linuxjourney.com/)
- [Linux Command Line Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxuRxtrO2Ag)
- [Linux Handbook](https://linuxhandbook.com/linux-commands/)

While not required, it would be useful to at least have a basic understanding of the Linux command line. This will help you navigate the file system, and install and configure the tools you need.
