## Installation

<Tabs items={['Linux', 'MacOS']}>
    <Tab>
        [Git](https://git-scm.com/) should already be installed on your Linux distribution. You can check by using `git --version` in the command line. However if it's not installed do so using:
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get install git
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        [Git](https://git-scm.com/) should already be installed on your MacOS version. You can check by using `git --version` in the command line. However if it's not installed do so using:
        ```bash
        brew install git
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Configuration

The Git config can be found at `~/.gitconfig`, but can also be setup using the command line. Let's set a global name and email (removing the `--global` tag can set up local configuration per repository).

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

GitHub gives you a no-reply email for your account, which I recommend you use to hide your real email. For more info look [here](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address).

```bash
git config --global user.email "<id>+<username>@users.noreply.github.com"
```

## Accessing the remote

To access the remote repository, you need to set up an SSH key. This is a public/private key pair that allows you to authenticate with the remote server without having to enter your password every time. You can read more about SSH keys [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).

### Generating a SSH key

To generate a new SSH key we use `ssh-keygen`.

> Make sure to use the no-reply email if available.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<id>+<username>@users.noreply.github.com"
```

### Adding the key to the ssh-agent

Next, we add our key to the `ssh-agent` to manage our keys. Start the `ssh-agent` in the background:

```bash
exec ssh-agent bash
```

Then add your private key.

<Tabs items={['Linux', 'MacOS']}>
    <Tab>
        ```bash
        ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
        ```

        Use `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` to show your public key, and finally add it to your GitHub account.

    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ```bash
        ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
        ```

        Make sure to also add the host to your `~/.ssh/config` file:

        ```
        Host github.com
        AddKeysToAgent yes
        UseKeychain yes
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
        ```

        Use `pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` to copy your public key, and finally add it to your GitHub account.
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Signed commits

Though this is highly optional, signing your commits proves that you are the author of the commit.

### Generating a GPG key

To be able to sign a commit we need a GPG key. Let's generate one:

```zsh
gpg --full-generate-key
```

Then we select the following options: RSA and RSA (default), 4096 bits and 0. Then enter the same name, and email as before (again the no-reply email is best). Finally, you are asked for a passphrase.

Use the `gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long`command to list the long form containing both public and private key. We require the private key to sign commits. From that list, we copy the long form of the GPG key ID (example: `3AA5C34371567BD2`) in:

```bash
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long
/Users/hubot/.gnupg/secring.gpg
------------------------------------
sec   4096R/3AA5C34371567BD2 2016-03-10 [expires: 2017-03-10]
uid                          Hubot <hubot@example.com>
ssb   4096R/4BB6D45482678BE3 2016-03-10
```

Then to print the full GPG key ID in ASCII armor format:

```bash
gpg --armor --export 3AA5C34371567BD2
```

Copy your GPG key, beginning with `-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----` and ending with `-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----`. Add it to your GitHub account.

### Signing your commits

First, make sure to tell Git which signing key to use (obviously use your own):

```shell
git config --global user.signingkey 3AA5C34371567BD2
```

then add `export GPG_TTY=$(tty)` to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file and restart your terminal. Then to sign commits we add the `-S` when using `git commit`:

```shell
$ git commit -S -m "YOUR_COMMIT_MESSAGE"
```

However, it is easier to configure Git to always sign your commits. We do this by updating the Git configuration again:

```shell
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```
