Please only start here if you are familiar with both TypeScript and Node.js. If you are not, please refer to our [programming skills section](/learning/programming) first.

## Have never done any backend development in Node.js before

While you might already be somewhat familiar with backend development if you've used things like Python Django/Flask, Java Spring, or Ruby on Rails, you might not have done any backend development in Node.js before. If that's the case, you should know that the simplest form of backend development in Node.js happens in the form of a HTTP server. This is a server that listens for HTTP requests and responds to them. The most common way to do this is with the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework. As such, we recommend to familiarize yourself with the basic concepts of an HTTP server and Express before continuing. Here are some resources:

- [Express documentation](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Full Stack course - Express](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part3)

Note that the course above uses MongoDB to store data, but we are using PostgreSQL. I recommend skipping the MongoDB part and just focusing on the Express part. You probably don't need to know a lot about databases to get started with this project, but we will handle this in a bit more detail in the next section.

## Have used Node.js before

If you have used Node.js before for backend development, you have probably used either Express, or a similar framework. This section will mainly focus on becoming familiar with the structure of our backend and the main libraries we are using. Here are some resources about the libraries we are using:

- [NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/)
- [Full Stack course - GraphQL](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part8)

For NestJS, it is important to familiarize yourself with the basic structure of modules, services, controllers, and resolvers. For Prisma, it is important to familiarize yourself with the API and how to use it. For GraphQL, it is important to familiarize yourself with the basic concepts of GraphQL and how to write queries and mutations.

## Where to go from here

Now that you know the basics about the backend, you can either go to the [frontend section](/learning/frontend) if you are more interested in the website or you can go to the [git section](/learning/git) if you want to learn how to start contributing to the project.
