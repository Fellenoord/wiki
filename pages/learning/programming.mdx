Since everyone prefers a different way to learn, we make a distinction between interactive courses, documentation and video tutorials. However, there are not always free resources available for all of these, so we have made a selection of the best free resources (in our opinion) for each of these categories.

## Absolute beginner

If you have never programmed before in your life, it might be a little difficult to get started, since JavaScript (or TypeScript) is not the easiest or most straight-forward language to learn. Nevertheless, here are some resources you can use to get started:

- [JavaScript docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)
- [Basic JavaScript (freeCodeCamp)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/)
- [Full Stack course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part0/fundamentals_of_web_apps)
- [YouTube JavaScript crash course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdI2bqOjy3c)

If you feel like JavaScript is not a good starting point, you might want to consider learning a different language first. For example, Python is a very popular language for beginners, and it is also used in many data science applications. You can find a lot of resources for Python on the internet, but here are some of our favorites:

- [Python Beginner's Guide](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide)
- [Python for Everybody (freeCodeCamp)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/)

While the syntax for Python is quite different from JavaScript, the concepts are very similar. So if you learn Python first, you will have an easier time learning JavaScript later on.

## Have done some programming before

Whether you have done some programming in JavaScript, Java or Python, the fundamentals are mostly the same. It is, however, important that you become familiar with the JavaScript syntax and also start grasping the fundamentals of TypeScript and Node.js. In essence, TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, so you can use JavaScript in TypeScript, but you can also use some of the more advanced features of TypeScript. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment, which means that you can run JavaScript code outside of the browser. Here are some resources to help you learn both:

- [JavaScript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/)
- [Introduction to Node.js](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/build-javascript-applications-nodejs/)
- [TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html)

If you have not used JavaScript before, we also recommend looking at the section above for absolute beginners to get a good foundation.

Please note that Node.js setup is covered in the [setup](/setup) section of this guide.

## Have used TypeScript before

If you have used TypeScript before, chances are that you are already familiar with Node.js. If you are not, please look at the section above to familiarize yourself with Node.js. If you understand the basics of TypeScript, you should be good to get started with the next sections of this guide.

## Where to go from here

Now that you have a good foundation, you can start looking at the [backend section](/learning/backend) or [frontend section](/learning/frontend). We highly recommend that you start with the backend section, since it is the most important part of the application. If you are not interested in the backend, you can also start with the frontend section, but you will probably have to learn the backend later on anyway.
