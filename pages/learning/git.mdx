Now that you are familiar with at least the basics of our project, you should also know how you can start contributing to our project. For this, we use a versioning control system called Git. Git is like Google Drive for code. It allows you to keep track of changes to your code and allows you to collaborate with other developers. Even though you might already be familiar with Git, we recommend you at least read the last section to get a better understanding of how we use Git.

## Have never used any versioning control system before

There's a lot that can be learned about versioning control systems in general, but to understand the basics, you should at least know the following:

- [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
- [Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)

## Have used Git before

Even though you might already be familiar with Git, there are still some particularities that you should know about our project. First of all, we use GitHub as our hosting platform of choice, meaning you should create a GitHub account (if you have not already) and request access to our repositories. You should also become familiar with our workflow, which can be found in our [workflow section](/workflow).
