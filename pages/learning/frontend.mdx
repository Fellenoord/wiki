Please only start here if you are familiar with both TypeScript and Node.js. If you are not, please refer to our [programming skills section](/learning/programming) first.

## Have never used React before

Whether you have already made websites using vanilla JavaScript and HTML, used Vue before or have not made any website before, you can start here. Since our frontend is built with React, you will need to learn React before you can start contributing to the frontend. Here are some resources to get you started:

- [React Documentation](https://react.dev/learn)
- [Full Stack course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/about)

While the React docs should be enough to familiarize yourself with React, the Full Stack course can be a great, but exhaustive resource to learn everything about React and web development in general. Not all parts of the course are relevant, and some parts cover some more basic concepts that you might already know (like HTTP requests), you can always skip those parts. Do note that the first parts are all in JavaScript, there is a part specifically about TypeScript (part 9) but in general, TypeScript does not differ much from JavaScript when it comes to React. Also keep in mind the [prerequisites](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part0/general_info) for the course, you will need to know some basic programming and Git.

## Have used React before

If you have already used React (preferably with TypeScript) before, you don't need to learn a whole lot extra. We are using Next.js as our framework of choice, which is a React framework that adds some extra features like server-side rendering and routing. To learn more about Next.js, we recommend the [official documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) as well as their [tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app). The tutorial is a great way to get started with Next.js, but you can also just read the documentation if you prefer that. Keep in mind the tutorial does not use TypeScript, but the difference between TypeScript and JavaScript is not that big when it comes to React.

## Have used Next.js before

If you have already used Next.js before and feel comfortable with it (including using it with TypeScript), you should be good to go. If you have used Next.js before but it was a while ago, make sure to read the documentation again to make sure you are familiar with the latest version of Next.js (we are using Next 13 at the time of writing).

## Where to go from here

Once you have familiarized yourself with Next.js, you might want to read up on some major frontend libraries we are using in the project. These are:

- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/getting-started) - our UI library
- [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) - our GraphQL client
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/get-started) - our form library

Otherwise, you can start looking at the [git section](/learning/git) to learn how to contribute to the project.
